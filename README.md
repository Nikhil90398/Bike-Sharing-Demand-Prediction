This repository consists of Rental Bike demand prediction required at each hour of the day so that stable supply of rental bikes
 can be made possible. This is done by applying various Regression Machine Learning Algorithms.

# Problem Statement

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.
