# Seoul-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
## This project will be explored over the previous data in order to predict the number of bikes that can be rented per hour by the company. So that customers can get the best experience without any delays. We will build different regression models and check which proves to be the best for the deployment.

This repository consists of Rental Bike demand prediction required at each hour of the day so that stable supply of rental bikes
 can be made possible. This is done by applying various Regression Machine Learning Algorithms.

# Project Flowchart:
     Loading data and Diagnosing the data
     Data Filtering
     EDA of Row data to understand inside correlations
     Feature Engineering
     Feature Selection : we are not use much beacuase of limited features in our data(only one feature elemenate using hitmap to escalate multicoliniarity issue)
     Model Building
     Model Training and Testing
     Model Evalution & Hyper Perameter tuning

# Steps involved doing this project:-

**Data Cleaning and Null values treatment:** Data cleaning is an important step in the data analytics process in which you either remove or update information that is incomplete or improperly formatted. Null values Treatment by different methods. We have our dataset in hand which is raw and unfiltered. This step involves cleaning our data first by eliminating the columns which are not needed for our analysis. We have around 8760 rows Ã— 14 columns in our dataset.Since, there were no null values, we have left it untouched.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis is the approach of analyzing data, gathering and summarizing the important characteristics of the information, and using simple visualization that makes it easier to understand.


**Importing necessary modules and libraries:**

We are importing the following libraries for their respective applications:

**Pandas:-** Pandas is used to analyze data. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

**Matplotlib:-** Matplotlib is a graph plotting library in python that serves as a visualization utility. Most of the Matplotlib utilities lie under the pyplot submodule.

**Numpy:-** NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra, Fourier transform, and matrices.

**SciKit:-** Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistent interface in Python. This library, which is largely written in Python, is built upon NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.

**Plotly:-** The plotly is an interactive, open-source plotting library that supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases.

**Seaborn:-** Seaborn is a library that uses Matplotlib underneath to plot graphs. It will be used to visualize random distributions.

**Datetime:-** The Datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times. While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is on efficient attribute extraction for output formatting and manipulation.

**Statsmodels:-** Statsmodels is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration.

**Conclusions:**

* Bike rental count is mostly correlated with the time of the day as it is peak at 8 am morning and 6 pm at evening.

* We observed that bike rental count is high during working days than non-working day.

* We see that people generally prefer to bike at moderate to high temperatures and when little windy.

* It is observed that highest number bike rentals counts in Autumn & Summer  seasons & the lowest in winter and spring season. 

* We observed that the highest number of  bike rentals on a clear day and the lowest on a snowy or rainy day and also  increasing humidity, the number of   bike rental counts decreases.
